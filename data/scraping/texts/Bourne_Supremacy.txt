1    EXT. MERCEDES WINDSHIELD -- DUSK                                       1

     It's raining...

     Light strobes across the wet glass at a rhythmic pace...

     Suddenly -- through the window a face -- JASON BOURNE --
     riding in the backseat -- his gaze fixed.


A1   INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT                                                A1

     On his knee -- a syringe and a gun --

     The eyes of the driver, JARDA, watching --

     BOURNE'S POV -- the passenger -- back of his HEAD -- cell
     phone rings -- the HEAD turns -- it's CONKLIN --

     BOURNE returns his stare...

     CUT TO --


2    INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                          2

     BOURNE'S EYES OPEN! -- panicked -- gasping -- trying to
     stay quiet -- MARIE sleeps.


A2   INT. COTTAGE LIVING AREA/BATHROOM -- NIGHT                            A2

     BOURNE moving for the medicine cabinet. Digs through the
     medicine cabinet. Downs something specific.

                                                                            3
3    INT./EXT. COTTAGE LIVING ROOM/VERANDA -- NIGHT
     One minute later.       BOURNE moves out onto the veranda.

     MARIE pads in. Watching him for a moment. Concerned.
     Clearly it's not the first time this has happened.

     The   y both loo   k differe   nt than last we    saw them;    his hair is

                 Where were you, Jason?

                                    BOURNE
                 In the car.         Conklin up front.

                                                               2.


                          MARIE
              I'll get the book.

                            BOURNE
              No.    There's nothing new.

                           MARIE
              You're sure?
                    (he nods)
              We should still -- we should write it
              down.

                          BOURNE
              Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --               *

                          MARIE
              -- it hasn't been two years --                            *

                             BOURNE
              -- it's alwa   ys bad and it's    never                   *
              anything but    bits and piece   s anyway!                *
                    (she's    gone quiet)                               *

              making it wo   rse? You don't     wonder that?            *

    She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him.

                          MARIE
              We write them down because sooner or                      *
              later you're going to remember something                  *
              good.                                                     *

                          BOURNE
                    (softens)
              I do remember something good.       All the
              time. I remember you.

    She smiles.     Kisses him.   Leads him back in.

                                                                    4
4   INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT
    MARIE getting BOURNE into the bed. Turning down the light.
    Getting him settled. Waiting for that pill to kick in.
    What would he do without her?

                          BOURNE
              I'm trying, Marie, Okay?

                          MARIE
              I worry when you get like this.

                                                             3.


                            BOURNE
                It's just a nightmare.

                            MARIE
                I don't mean that.   I worry when you try
                to ignore it.

    He    hesitates. But that gets him. He knows she's right.
    And    with that opening, he's letting go. Resistance
    fol   ding. Almost childlike. She's gathering him in.
    He'   s letting her do it...

                             MARIE (CONT'D)
                Sleep.   Sleep now.

                            BOURNE
                I should be better by now.

                            MARIE
                You are better. And I think it's not
                memories at all. It's just a dream you
                keep having over and over.

                            BOURNE
                But it ends up the same.

                             MARIE
                One day it will be different. It just
                takes time.
                      (beat)
                We'll make new memories. You and me.

    Silence. She strokes his face. He gives in to her
    tenderness. He's fading. Two waifs in the dark.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

5   EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY
    BOU   RNE running in the sun. A punishing pace along the
    san   d. Moving strong. Effortless. Deep into it. Focused.
    The    stunning conjunction of sun and scenery are lost on
    him   .


6   EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY                   6

    A busy market town. Fishing town. Hippie town. Lots of
    young Western faces. Rundown and happening at the same
    time.

    MARIE shopping.      Filling a bag with local produce.

                                                          4.


7   EXT. ROAD -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY                          7

    BOURNE still running, leaving the beach behind.


8   INT. COTTAGE KITCHEN -- DAY                                8

    MARIE back from the market, putting the groceries away.
    Almost done, when she stops for a moment --

    A PHOTOGRAPH. There on the windowsill. A snapshot. Jason
    and Marie on a beach. Her arms around him. As if she were
    the protector. Big smiles. Young. Alive. In love.

    MARIE smiles.


9   EXT. MAIN STREET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY                   9

    Funky busy. Colonial facades in vivid, sub-continental
    technicolor. Loud morning traffic.

    CAMERA FINDS

    BOURNE coming out of a store with a big bottle of water.
    He's just finished his run. Standing there, chugging away,
    checking the scene, when something catches his eye --

    HIS POV

    THE STREET. A SILVER CAR -- something newish -- pulling
    down the block -- can't quite see who's driving, but --

    BACK TO

    BOURNE watching this silver car. So serious he's casual.
    Nobody passing would notice, but we do: He's on alert.
    MOVING WITH HIM AS
    BOURNE follows THE SILVER CAR on foot -- natural --
    cruising the BUSY SIDEWALK -- blending into the mix --
    chugging on that water bottle and --

    UP AHEAD

    THE SILVER CAR making the corner and turning now --

    BACK TO
    BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --

                                                                      5.


     HIS POV

     THE    SILVER CA   R has   par   ked. There's a GUY -- well-dressed --
     cas   ual -- phy   sical   --    sunglasses -- call him KIRILL -- he's
     out    of the ca   r and   hea   ding across the street toward a
     bui   lding ther   e. A    TEL   EGRAPH OFFICE.

     BACK TO

     BOURNE checking his watch.            The car.   The guy.   Perimeter.


10   INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE/GOA -- DAY                                      10   *

     MR. MOHAN at his desk. He's a crisp, proper man of fifty.
     He's just been handed something --

     A PHOTOGRAPH OF MARIE -- an old passport picture.

                             MR. MOHAN
                 And your question, sir?

     KIRILL across the desk.

                             KIRILL
                 She's my sister. There's been a
                 death in the family. This is the
                 last place we know she called from.


11   INT. COTTAGE -- DAY                                                   11

     A NOTE ON THE TABLE:             "I'M AT THE BEACH"

     BOURNE has just come in -- just read the note -- balling it
     quickly. In fact, everything is quickly now, because --

     BOURNE is bailing.
     Fast. Calm. Methodical. Some exfil procedure that he's
     honed and choreographed. Packing like a machine --

     RAPID TIME CUTS
     -- BACKPACKS thrown open on the bed. -- HOUSE CASH pulled
     from a lamp base. -- CREDIT CARDS taped under the counter.


12   EXT. MAIN STREET/BANK GOA/BEACH TOWN -- DAY                           12

     KIRILL coming out of the bank. Mission accomplished.
     Heading back to the SILVER CAR. Getting in and --

                                                              6.


13    INT. SILVER CAR -- DAY (CONT)                                13

      KIRILL starting it up. Glancing around nice and easy.
      He's cool. Putting the car into gear, he makes a slow pass        *
      through the marketplace. Eyes everywhere.                         *


14    DELETED                                                      14   *

      BOURNE -- done -- the place is stripped -- pulling on the
      backpacks -- glancing around -- one last thing -- shit, he
      almost missed it --

      THE PHOTOGRAPH -- the one of he and Marie on the beach --
      the one we saw her looking at earlier -- there it is on the
      windowsill -- jamming it into his pocket and --


A16   EXT. SIDE STREET/PARKING AREA -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY    A16      *

      KIRILL now parked and out of the car -- on the move -- on         *
      foot -- he begins a sweep of the beach.                           *


16    EXT. COTTAGE BACK DOOR -- YARD/ALLEY -- DAY (CONT)           16

      BOURNE out the back -- jogging -- keeping low -- into the
      neighborhood -- through the alleys -- nothing random about
      it, this has all been worked out and --


17    DELETED                                                      17   *

18    EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY
      Crowded with tourists -- sunbathers -- MARIE at her
      favorite spot. Talking with TWO WOMEN, laughing with them -
      - happy.


18A   EXT. BEACH/PARKING AREA -- GOA -- DAY                    18A      *

      A burly JEEP comes roaring up. BOURNE spots the SILVER            *
      CAR, parks at the other end -- takes off towards the beach.       *

                                                                  7.

     KIRILL methodically making his way up the beach --                     *
     checking every blue tent -- every towel.                               *

     BOURNE coming up the beach the opposite way -- one eye on              *
     KIRILL, one eye on MARIE.                                              *

     He arrives just as KIRILL looks up and sees them a                     *
     hundred yards away -- a hard stare between them -- BOURNE              *
     bends down --                                                          *

                             BOURNE
                 We gotta go, Marie.       We gotta go, now.

     Fro   m the tone    of his voice, she knows it's serious.              *
     Mar   ie grabs h   er bag. A quick goodbye to the friends.             *

     They reach the JEEP -- she knows the drill -- bag tossed in            *
     the back -- even as the Jeep pulls away and --                         *

                                  BOURNE
                 We're blown.

     She hesitates.       One minute ago everything was fine.

                                  MARIE
                 No...     How?

                             MARIE
                 But we were so careful.

                             BOURNE
                 We pushed it. We got lazy.                                 *

                But you're sure?

                            BOURNE
                He was at the campground yesterday.

                               MARIE
                So...                                                  *

     Trying to decide whether to pull out or back up --

                That's crazy.                                          *

                               BOURNE

25   INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY (CONT)                                     25   *

     KIRILL trapped in some Main Street gridlock. Glancing back
     for a way out -- freezing suddenly, because there --

     HIS POV -- THE JEEP -- THE ALLEY -- right there -- twenty
     yards back -- a good look at BOURNE and MARIE -- as they
     disappear and --


26   EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY (CONT)                   26

     THE JEEP backing up the way it came -- BLOWING ITS HORN
     because an OLD VAN pulls in and blocks him from behind --


27   INT. JEEP -- DAY (CONT)                                        27

     BOURNE leaning on THE HORN -- shit, now they've got to
     wait!

                             MARIE                                       *

                 We can't wait to be sure.                               *

     KIR   ILL. Calm. Possessed of a familiar tactical patience.
     He    can't get the Hyundai to the alley from where he is and       *
     it    doesn't make sense to go on foot. He checks his
     rea   rview.

                                                          10.


     Fuck it -- there's an opening ahead and he's taking it --       *
     even though it's away from them -- he'll find another way --    *


29   EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY -- (CONT)            29

     BOURNE sees the HYUNDAI move forward into traffic.   THE OLD    *
     VAN is still blocking them from behind --                       *

                              BOURNE                                 *

               -- make the left -- toward the bridge --              *

     MARIE scrambling over the seat.   BOURNE, eyes everywhere,      *
     checks his watch.                                               *

     THE JEEP squirts back on the main street and --


30   INT. JEEP -- DAY -- CONT                                   30

     MARIE at the wheel -- adrenaline pumping -- clear running
     for thirty yards ahead and --

     MARIE skidding them into the right turn -- clipping another
     vehicle -- MIRROR SHATTERING! -- speeding up.

     BOURNE scanning behind them -- MARIE moving out to pass --
     veering back! -- an ONCOMING BUS -- just in time and --

               he was ready --

     KIRILL stopping short on a rise.    Bit of a view from here.     *
     Gets half out the car to look.                                   *

     BELOW -- the JEEP headed for A BRIDGE. He's gonna lose           *
     them. KIRILL'S mind racing. Grabs duffle from the back,          *
     abandons car.                                                    *

      HER POV

      The old CONCRETE BRIDGE ahead.    Almost there.


33    EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY/SUNSET                                 33

      KIRILL slams into it. Quick, precise grabs into the bag.
      Only a moment and he's got a SNIPER RIFLE.


A34   INT. JEEP -- BRIDGE -- DAY                               A34

      BOURNE -- pistol in hand -- spare clip in the other --           *
      checks his watch.                                                *

                            MARIE                                      *

      KIRILL.   Eye to the scope.                                      *

      SNIPER SCOPE POV

      There! The JEEP rumbling across the bridge. No clear
      target, just the back of the full DRIVER'S SIDE HEADREST.

      KIRILL'S FINGER

      Squeezing.   Firing.

                                                                  13.


34   EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE -- DAY (CONT)                                   34

     The JEEP jerking.

     FRONT FENDER tearing into and along the guard rail --
     cement shards fill the air --

     BOURNE reaching for the wheel -- Too late!

     As the JEEP finally crashes through the flimsy guardrail --

     Plummets -- splashes hard -- begins to sink out of sight.


35   EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY (CONT)                                        35

     KIR   ILL lowers    the scop   e, takes a quick look around. He's
     bas   ically gon   e unnotic   ed in this little nook with his
     sil   enced rifl   e. But p    eople are already rushing toward the
     bri   dge. Then    ... there   !

     An OLD WOMAN looking directly at KIRILL from a doorway.
     Not quite sure what. But an old Indian woman in Goa? So
     what.

     KIRILL drills her with a look.          As she sinks back inside --


36   INT. JEEP -- SINKING IN THE RIVER -- DAY/SUNSET                    36

     Swallowed up.       BOURNE and MARIE gone.                              *


37   EXT. LOW WALL -- SUNSET                                            37

     KIRILL scans the surface of the river under the bridge.
     Waiting.

                                                                        38
38   EXT. RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY
     Mud plumes as the JEEP settles.          BOURNE reaches over to         *
     MARIE, tries to urge her out.                                           *


39   EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY                                               39

     KIRILL with a killer's patience, waiting, almost done.

     SCOPE POV
     The surface of the water.          Unbroken.

                                                                14.


        KIRILL

        Scans his perimeter. There's the old woman again. But
        more people with her. People coming out of the woodwork.

        KIRILL checks the surface one last time.   Nothing.

        He breaks down the rifle in moments -- goes.                       *


40      EXT. JEEP -- RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY                              40

        BOURNE -- up into an air pocket held by the jeep's canvas
        top. A big gulp of air --

        And he's back to MARIE. Frantic. Trying to unclip her              *
        seatbelt. Pull her out. But it's all jammed up.                    *


41      EXT. KIRILL -- BY THE SILVER CAR                              41

        Bag chucked in the back. All he has left is the scope.             *
        One last look to the unbroken surface. Then it's time to
        go. KIRILL -- drifting away -- disappears.


42      EXT. JEEP -- RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY                              42

         BOURNE going through the footlocker. Setting aside his

       A hard working port.     A big MEDITERRANEAN FERRY coming in.

       FERRY -- BOURNE at the rail. Unchanged from India.
       Staring ahead as Europe looms.

                    ...what can    I do? I can't. I'll call you
                    when I know    what I'm into...

                    So start wit   hout me, if I can get there, I
                    will. Later    ...

          NEVINS hangs up and pockets the phone.    He hustles towards
          the building.


122       INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM -- DAY                              122

          The room is jumping. Agents tracking, working the phones
          and computers. PAMELA giving orders. ABBOTT watches.

                                                               33.

123   INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET                 123

      As NEVINS flashes his credentials to CARABINIERI at door,
      who gives an unimpressed shrug and lets him in.

      NEVINS takes his overcoat off, tosses it on the empty
      chair. We see a big ass .45 for just a second under his
      suit jacket.

                               NEVINS
                Alright, Mr.    Bourne, is that your name?
                      (BOURN   E nods)
                Name's Nevin   s. I'm with the US Consulate.
                Could I see    your passport?

      BOURNE, silent, hands over his passport.

                            NEVINS (CONT'D)
                So, Mr. Bourne...

      NEVINS studies Bourne's passport...

                            NEVINS (CONT'D)                            *
                What are you doing in Tangiers?

      Silence...                                                       *

                            NEVINS (CONT'D)
                      (faux friendly)
                Are you travelling alone?                              *

                                                             34.


       BOURNE stares straight ahead. NEVINS comes around the         *
       table and sits in front of BOURNE.                            *

                             NEVINS (CONT'D)                         *
                       (in his face)                                 *
                 Look, I don't know what you've done.                *
                 But, you're gonna need to play ball here.           *

       NEVINS cell starts to ring.    He shrugs an apology, turns    *
       away and answers:                                             *

                 with a Jason Bourne now?                            *

                             NEVINS
                       (listens; looks at Bourne)
                 Yes...

123    INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET              123

       Whatever Nevins is being told, it's concerning.    BOURNE
       watching him. Knows exactly what this is.

       CLOSE ON NEVINS as he steps away, listening intently. His
       hand just starting to move toward his shoulder holster.

                             NEVINS (cont'd)
                 Okay, I'll call you right back.

       NEVINS flips shut his phone.   He reaches for his gun, even
       as he turns, and --

       BOURNE is right there in his face. WHUMP! Momentum and
       gravity reaching mutual agreement as NEVINS hits the deck.

       CARABINIERI barely clears his holster before -- CHOP --
       CHOP -- BOURNE has him down in a heap.

                                                                             35.


          BOURNE is back, silent and effective.

          FINALLY

          BOURNE -- exits the door, wedging a desk under the handle
          so it cannot be opened from the inside and calmly walks
          away like nothing ever happened --


124       EXT. NAPLES FERRY BUILDING -- NIGHT                                  124

          And now we see the old BOURNE, in his long black coat,
          purposely striding out of the building. He pauses long
          enough for the security camera to get a good look at him.

          THE RONIN returns.


125       EXT. NAPLES FERRY PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               125

          BOURNE crosses the street and approaches a man putting his
          suitcase in the trunk of a green Peugeot. BOURNE reaches
          into his bag, pulls out some cash.

127       INT. FERRY/SECURITY HOLDING ROOM -- NIGHT
          NEVINS stirring, the CARABINIERI still out. A phone starts
          to RING. Nevins' phone. Finally sitting up, he answers.

                                         NEVINS

131    EXT. NAPLES STREET -- NIGHT                                    131

       BOURNE sits in the dark car. Headphones. A nest of cool
       gadgetry -- on the passenger seat. Listening in --                    *
       recording --

       He writes: Pamela Landy -- circles it.

       PEUGEOT ROARING TO LIFE, as he writes the number.                         *

       Dropping the car into gear, BOURNE pulls briskly away from

        BOURNE driving -- listening to playback of Pamela's
        conversation with Nevins.

                              PAMELA/TAPE
                    "Jason Bourne is armed and extremely

       THE DRIVER looks back. We see him. (We'll know him later

       ABBOTT stands there beside a parked car. The passenger
       door open. Message clear. Get the fuck in.


135    INT. US AIR FORCE BASE, ENGLAND -- DAY                   135

       Inside a hanger. Inside an office. ABBOTT watching as
       CRONIN questions NICKY. PAMELA sits on a window sill.

                              CRONIN
                  So your cover at the time was what?

                              NICKY
                  That I was an American student in Paris.

                              CRONIN
                  What exactly did your job with Treadstone
                  in Paris consist of?

       Nicky looks to Abbott. He nods that it's okay to               *
       answer. Pamela bristles at the check-off.                      *

         age   nts, to m   ake sure they were up to    date
         wit   h their m   edications.

                     CRONIN
         Health, meaning what?

                     NICKY
         Their mental health.       Because of what
         they'd been through.       They were prone to a
         variety of problems.

                     PAMELA
               (losing patience)                                    *
         What kind of problems?

                     NICKY
         Depression. Anger. Compulsive
         behaviors. They had physical symptoms --
         headaches -- sensitivity to light --

         Before this?        Before Bourne?   No.

                     ABBOTT
         Were you familiar with the training
         program?

                     NICKY
         The details? No. I mean,         I was told it
         was voluntary. I don't kno       w if that's
         true or not, but that's wha      t I was told.
               (a bit defensive)
         Look, they took vulnerable       subjects,
         okay? You mix that with th       e right
         pharmacology and some serio      us behavior
         modification, and, I don't       know, I mean,

                              PAMELA

         You're making it out like we're friends
         here or something. I met him alone twice.

                     PAMELA
         You felt nothing? No spark? Two young
         people in Paris? Dangerous missions?
         Life and death?

                     NICKY
               (incredulous)
         You mean, did I want a date?

         Did you?

                     NICKY
         These were killers. Conklin had them all
         jacked up. They were Dobermans.

                     PAMELA
         Some women like Dobermans --

       Everything stops, as THE PHOTO -- blurry, oblique -- begins
       materializing on HALF-A-DOZEN MONITORS around the room.
       Suddenly, they're surrounded by Bourne.

                               PAMELA
                         (to Nicky)
                   Is it him?

                   He's not hiding, that's for sure.

                   Why Naples?     Why now?

       PAMELA has gone quiet, just staring at the picture, as --

                               KURT
                   Could be random.

                             CRONIN
                 Maybe he's running.

       ABBOTT looks skeptical.

                             ABBOTT
                 On his own passport?

                 What's he doing? He's making his first

       And then, from behind them --

                 It's not a m   istake.

INTO

THE KITCHEN. He drops his briefcase on the table, opens
the fridge for a drink. Except what he comes out with is --

A GUN!

Wheeling around. The salaryman is JARDA.        JARDA from
Bourne's dream. But as he turns --

BOURNE behind him.   Bigger gun.     Waiting.   So ready.

                      BOURNE
          I emptied it.

                      JARDA
                (a total pro)
          Felt a little light.

                        BOURNE
          Drop it.

JARDA lets the gun fall, looks his old comrade over a beat.

But Bourne's not interested in a reunion.

                        BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
          Here...

Bourne tosses him FLEXCUFFS -- JARDA puts his hands behind
his back, turns to let BOURNE cinch them.

          Sorry. Old habits.

                              Sit.
BOURNE kicks over a chair.

BOURNE checking JARDA'S briefcase -- tearing through it --

                      BOURNE
          You still should've moved.

                      JARDA
          I like it here.

                       JARDA (CONT'D)
           Last time I saw you was Greece.      You had a
           good spot.

BOURNE reacts -- doesn't look over -- but realizes...

                          JARDA (CONT'D)                          *
           I had the gi   rl. I had her lined up that

                 (defen   sive)
           You ever do    two targets? It's tough.

BOURNE turns.   Cold.

                        BOURNE
           She wouldn't let me.
                 (beat)
           She's the only reason you're alive.

Silence.   JARDA down a peg.       Or two.

                       JARDA
           What do you want?

                          BOURNE
           Conklin.

                          JARDA
           He's dead.

BOURNE -- the gun -- right to Jarda's face --

                          BOURNE
           Try again.

                       JARDA
           Shot dead in Paris.       Dead the night you
           walked out.

                       BOURNE/PHONE
           Then who runs Treadstone?

                       JARDA
           Nobody. They shut it down. We're the
           last two. It's over...
                 (not finishing because--)

-- he's falling! -- landing hard -- BOURNE just kicked the
chair out from under him --

                                                          48.


                       BOURNE
           You're lying. If it's over, why are they
           after me?

                       JARDA
           I don't know.

                       BOURNE
           Who sent you to Greece?

                        JARDA
           A voice. A voice from the States.
           Someone new.

                       BOURNE
           Pamela Landy?

                       JARDA
           I don't know who that is.

                       BOURNE
           What's going on in Berlin?

                       JARDA
           I don't know! Why would I lie?

Silence.   BOURNE pulls back.      Unsure.

JARDA makes it to his feet.

                       JARDA (CONT'D)                           *
           What the hell did you do? You must have
           really screwed up.

BOURNE doesn't know.      He backs off.

                          JARDA (CONT'D)
           She really d   id that? Told you not to kill
           me?
                 (beat)
           I had a woma   n once. But after a while,
           what do you    talk about? I mean, for us.
           The work. Y    ou can't tell them who you
           are...

                          BOURNE
           I did.

JARDA hesitates. It's really like Bourne just told him how
much he loved her.

                       JARDA
           I thought you were here to kill me.

                                                                   49.


      Something in the way he said it.          Plus Jarda just glanced
      at his watch.

                              BOURNE
                  What did you do?

      JARDA shrugs, almost embarrassed. BOURNE looks across to
      the alarm pad Jarda hit on the way in. Voltage -- like a
      switch.

                              BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
                  You called it in?

                                     JARDA
                  I'm sorry.

                              BOURNE
                  How long? How long do I have --
                        (stopping because--)

      THE PHONE JUST STARTED RINGING -- loud -- insistent --

                                     BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)

164       INT. BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT                         164

          The    bullpen is cranking -- phones to Munich -- lines to
          Lan   gley -- ABBOTT watching from the sidelines -- KURT and
          KIM    at their work stations -- PAMELA on mobile, turns to
          ABB   OTT --

                                     PAMELA
                      So he beats    a man within an inch of his             *

                            (at Ni   cky)
                      For someone    with amnesia, he certainly
                      hasn't forgo   tten how to kill, has he?

          Across the room -- CRONIN and TEDDY suddenly excited about
          what they're seeing on THEIR SCREEN --

                                                                53.


                            CRONIN
                -- hey! -- they've got him boxed in! --
                      (new data coming up on the
                       monitor)

      Everyone rushing to look.    Excited, except --

                               ZORN
                Forget it.     They lost him.

                            TEDDY
                What're you talking about?      They've got a
                three block perimeter.

                            ZORN
                You can't see him? He's not in front of
                you? Forget it. He's gone.

                            CRONIN                                      *
                      (fuck you, buzzkill)                              *
                It's not gonna be like last time.                       *

                            ZORN
                You better start listening to someone.                  *
                Cause we've been there.                                 *

                            ABBOTT                                      *
                Okay, enough...                                         *
                      (stepping in)                                     *
                Take a walk, Danny.    Get some air.                    *

      Zorn nods.   Happy to.                                            *

                            NICKY
                      (piping in)
                I don't think we need to keep looking for
                him anyway.

                            PAMELA
                And why is that?

                            NICKY
                Because he's doing just what he said he'd               *
                do. He's coming for us.

      And for the first time they're all thinking the same thing.

                                                                  165
165   EXT. HOTEL BRECKER -- BERLIN -- NIGHT -- RAIN
      It is pouring rain. Seen from that Hellish car, A HUGE,
      DISTINCTIVE, NEEDLE-LIKE TOWER dominates the skyline,
      lights flashing through the dark and wet --

                                                              54.


166    INT. THE AUDI/REST-STOP -- NIGHT                            166

       BOURNE'S EYES OPENING! -- heart pounding -- springing up --
       alone -- damn, his side hurts -- recoiling from that --
       where is he? -- he's in the car -- looking around and --

       HIS WINDSHIELD POV

       AN AUTOBAHN REST-STOP.    Gas station.   Sleeping trucks.

       BACK TO

       BOURNE catching his breath -- shifting away from the pain
       in his rib -- checking his watch -- but what the hell is
       that on his sleeve? -- fuck, it's BLOOD -- JARDA's blood --


167    EXT. AUTOBAHN REST-STOP -- NIGHT                            167

       BOURNE out of the car fast -- careless -- wrong -- not even
       checking who's watching -- pulling off the shirt -- tearing
       it off -- throwing it down and --

       Standing there. In the weird light.      A big bruise ripening
       on his side. Looking around.

       It's okay.   Nobody's watching.   But, shit, man...

       Get it together.


A167   INT. PEUGEOT -- AUTOBAHN -- NIGHT                       A167

       Streaking along.     BOURNE back to his mission.

       KIRILL striding through the terminal.     Moving quickly
       toward a departure gate and --

       THE CAMERA FINDS

       GRETKOV above.     Watching him go.

                                                                       55.

179       INT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION -- DAWN                              179

          Quiet and forlorn this early. Just like BOURNE who's
          taking A LOCKER. Stashing A BACKPACK. Prepping the evac.
          Always ready. He heads outside, we hear:

                                HOTEL OPERATOR #1 (V.O.)
                          (front desk German)

A179      INT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION PHONE KIOSK -- DAWN                 A179

          BOURNE tucked in with a BERLIN GUIDE BOOK, a felt tip pen,
          and a Fifty-Euro phonecard. Working it.

                                BOURNE/PHONE

          Crossing out another Hotel off the list -- four down, forty
          to go -- as we start TIME CUTTING and...

B179   INT. PAMELA'S HILTON HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN                            B179

       Clean and plain. A bed nobody's slept in. THE PHONE
       begins ringing. PAMELA, fresh from the shower, rushing out
       from the bathroom to answer it --

       HIS POV

       THE FERNSEHTURM looming as they pass, the Berlin TV Tower.
       That needle in the sky. From the flashback. And then --

                 This is not a drill, soldier. We're clear

                                BOURNE

       BOURNE sitting in the back seat of the cab. Frozen there.
       Rocked. What's happening to him? No chance to work it
       out, because the taxi's stopped and --

                             TAXI DRIVER
                       (waiting; irritated)

G179
       Concentric rings looking down on each other. BOURNE
       slipping in unnoticed, taking a quick look up before
       moving along.


H179   INT. HEALTH CLUB -- GRAND HOTEL -- DAY                   H179   *

       BOURNE stepping up to the GUY behind the desk.    The gym       *
       mostly empty.                                                   *

                 Hi. I think I left my backpack here                   *
                 yesterday. Black, Nike.                               *

       The guy disappears in back to check.                             *

       BOURNE leans across the counter, scrolling the COMPUTER --       *
       the guest list -- his finger stabbing down on...                 *

       SCREEN: Landy, Pamela 413.

       BOURNE clears the screen, walks away.


J179   INT. CONCENTRIC RINGS -- GRAND HOTEL -- DAY               J179

       Because of the set-up, Bourne, pretending to talk on a
       house phone, has a view of ROOM 413 across the way. The
       door opens, PAMELA exits, carrying an overnight bag --           *

       BOURNE watches.

                              TEDDY
                 No.   Munich's a bust.   He's loose.                   *

       BOURNE walking right past them -- he's got the whole thing
       scoped -- heading quickly across the street and --

           KIRILL walks down the same hallway Gretkov came to meet him
           last time.

           A GUY carrying a briefcase toward him. Stopping for a

           briefcase. Smooth. Like it never happened --

       BOURNE -- eyes locked on the target.   Scanning.    Waiting.

NICKY reacts to the name.   Runs to the other room to try

          What do you want?

          I want to come in.

back in with Conklin -- PAMELA waving for a pencil.

                      PAMELA

          Who?

          There was a girl in Paris. Part of the
          program. She used to handle the
          medication.

AND NOW WE STAY WITH

PAMELA -- her eyes flicker over to NICKY.

                      PAMELA
          What if we can't find her?

                Your first assignment was Geneva.

                                                                            71.


                               BOURNE
                   That's a lie!

                               NICKY
                         (emphatic)
                   You never worked Berlin...

       BOURNE raising the gun -- eyes gone dead -- oh, shit...

                               NICKY (CONT'D)
                   No...Jason...please...

                                        BOURNE
                   I was here!

                                   NICKY
                   ...    it's not in the file...I swear...I

       He's so ready to kill her. NICKY starting to cry -- hands
       over her face -- covering up -- bracing for the bullet she
       knows is coming --

       BOURNE -- about to pull the trigger --

       BOURNE swamped -- thrown -- hesitating --

       CLOSE ON NICKY

       Sobbing now -- when? -- finally looking out, and --

       BOURNE IS GONE!


C193   INT. BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT                                  C193

       An hour later.          Whole new vibe.    Siege mode.     Curtains
       drawn.

       THREE DELTA DUDES parked around the room.               KURT and KIM            *
       working the phones and screens.

                                                                72.


      The mood is dark. PAMELA, ABBOTT, CRONIN all in here,
      the "safe" zone, away from the windows --

                                  CRONIN

      PAMELA turns, looking at the photo of BOURNE in Naples.           *
      Introspective.                                                    *

                            PAMELA

       KIRILL wearing headphones, listening to a BERLIN POLICE
       FREQUENCY. There's an INTERPOL "WANTED" PICTURE OF JASON
       BOURNE there on the seat. He's in play.


D193   INT. BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT                     D193

       Quiet, intense activity.     MILITARY RADIOS CHIRPING here
       and there.

       THE CAMERA FINDS

       ZORN moving through the bullpen, carrying a cup of coffee,
       heading back toward PAMELA'S OFFICE where --

       ABBOTT is leaning in the doorway. Past him, inside, we can
       see PAMELA in the midst of a tough phone conversation.
       CRONIN and THE DELTA BOSS sitting there with her.

                              ZORN
                        (the coffee)
                  Sir...

                               ABBOTT
                  Thanks.

       ABBOTT nods.   Takes a sip.   Looking beat.

                              ZORN (cont'd)
                  I have that number you wanted...

       ABBOTT hesitates -- but only a moment -- he never asked for
       a number. But he's playing along. Looking satisfied as
       ZORN hands him a slip of paper.

                              ABBOTT
                        (glancing at it)
                  She say what time I should call?

                              ZORN
                  The sooner the better.

       ABBOTT nods. Pockets the paper.     Turning back, as if it
       were nothing and --

       ON THE MONITOR

       A BERLIN NEWSPAPER ARCHIVE.          There it is.     Written large in

       BOURNE is reading it.

       And we're reading in his face. That he is rocked.                     That he
       has found another bottom to the abyss.

       Remember the building where Vic was killed?             We're back.

       ZORN and ABBOTT making their way in. Zorn steering them
       away toward a stairwell at the back...

       ZORN and ABBOTT have snuck in here.              Work light.    Signs
       of repair on the wall.
